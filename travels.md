## Travel Stories


- In 2010 (I was 17) I went to Ecuador for the Pan-American Championships for competitive climbing. The government was in the middle of a coupe at the time, so I arrived in the airport to dozens and dozens of soldiers with fully automatic weapons and literal rocket launchers. Twice while driving through the mountains from Quito to Ibarra, the 4 tour buses carrying the 50+ youth US Team athletes and their families were pulled over for searches to make sure we weren't there to help the group that was trying to overthrow the government.

- The President's grand-niece (I think?) was competing in the competition so roughly 3-4 city blocks around the competition venue were closed to blockades and we had to go through a security check every single day going into and leaving the venue. Honestly was probably the safest place to be during the coupe but who knows! That wasn't even the scariest part!

- The scariest part was for the 10 days we were there, I kept seeing these **BEAUTIFUL** dragonfly-like creatures all over our hotel's gardens. They had a vivid blue body and translucent orange wings. I had been chasing them around and taking photos of them for a week! I literally had some of them land on me at one point. The second to last day of the event I was out in the garden when the groundskeepers came out and yelled at me in broken English to stay away from them. I couldn't understand why, but he shooed me away and I never tried to touch them again. I assumed they were sacred or endangered.

- When I got home I posted photos of them on Facebook and asked anyone with any knowledge to tell me what they were. It turns out they were tarantula hawks. As in a species of WASP that feeds on TARANTULAS. They are considered to have one of the most painful stings in the animal kingdom. Not kill you bad, but you'll never experience pain like this again pain.
