####Motivation

1. The biggest motivation for wanting to change my career has been the desire to be able to support myself financially. I come from a family that made pretty questionable choices growing up and while none of my educational or career choices in my life have led me down that path, I really want to make sure I set myself up for success and to give myself the opportunity to support myself and my family in the future if I choose to have one.

2. The pandemic hit the climbing industry pretty hard and I also sustained two injuries just before and in the middle of the pandemic and with everything happening it gave me a really good chance to step away from something that wasn't making me as happy as it had for most of my life.

3. I have always loved the idea of working in tech. I took CS classes all through HS before pursuing my athletic career and I knew the transition was going to happen eventually, so why wait any longer?! :)
